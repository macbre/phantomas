phantomas [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/phantomas.svg)]() [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/macbre/phantomas.png?branch=devel)](http://travis-ci.org/macbre/phantomas) [![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/macbre/phantomas/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/macbre/phantomas)
=========

PhantomJS-based modular web performance metrics collector. And why phantomas? Well, [because](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantômas) :)

## Requirements

* [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) 4+
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) 3+

## Installation

```
npm install --global --no-optional phantomas phantomjs-prebuilt@^2.1.5
```

> This will install the latest version of PhantomJS and add a symlink called ``phantomas`` (pointing to ``./bin/phantomas.js``) to your system's ``PATH``

You may need to install libfontconfig by running ``sudo apt-get install libfontconfig1``.

### Development version

To get the latest development version of phantomas (and install all required dependencies):

```
git clone git@github.com:macbre/phantomas.git
npm install
```

## Having problems?

Please refer to **[/Troubleshooting.md](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas/blob/devel/Troubleshooting.md)**

## Libraries

phantomas is written in JavaScript, but you can experience it in different languages as well ;)

### Python

[![Latest Version](https://pypip.in/version/phantomas/badge.svg?style=flat)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/phantomas/)
[![Supported Python versions](https://pypip.in/py_versions/phantomas/badge.svg?style=flat)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/phantomas/)

```
pip install phantomas
```

## Features

* modular approach - each metric is generated by a separate "module"
* phantomas "core" acts as an [events emitter](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas/wiki/Events) that each module can hook into
* in-depth metrics such as: number of events bound via jQuery, calls to ``window.write``or [complex and duplicated CSS selectors (via analyze-css)](https://github.com/macbre/analyze-css)
* JSON and CSV as available output formats for easy integration with automated reporting / monitoring tools
* easy integration with Continuous Integration tools via TAP format and assertions handling
* metrics can be sent via StatsD or stored in elasticsearch
* easy integration with other nodejs projects via CommonJS module ([see API docs](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas/wiki/npm-module))
* metrics can be emitted from JavaScript code of the page phantomas is run against (thanks to [helper functions available in window.__phantomas](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas/wiki/Phantomas-scope))
* device profiles allow phantomas to emulate mobile or tablet (by setting a proper user agent and viewport)
* ability to run phantomas using WebKit (PhantomJS) or Gecko (SlimerJS) engine (experimental)

## Usage

> phantomas comes as both command line tool and CommonJS module ([see API docs](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas/wiki/npm-module)) that you can use in your nodejs projects.

### Single run

``` bash
phantomas https://github.com/macbre/phantomas --verbose
```

You can measure the performance of your site without requests to 3rd party domains (but allowing CDN that serves your static assets):

```bash
phantomas https://github.com/macbre/phantomas --verbose --no-externals --allow-domain .fastly.net
```

You can provide phantomas config via JSON or YAML file. We [support environment variables in YAML config files](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas/issues/685) ([the way Docker does](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/)].

```
./bin/phantomas.js --config examples/config.yaml
URL='https://www.google.is' ./bin/phantomas.js --config examples/config.yaml
```

An example config file with customizable test URL for various environments (production, staging, sandboxes, ...):

```yaml
url: "https://${ENV:-prod}.super-fast-app.io"
```

* cssParsingErrors: number of CSS files (or embeded CSS) that failed to be parse by analyze-css

### Reporters

phantomas provides a number of reporters that can format the run results and send them to various tools. Use ``--reporter`` (or ``-R`` shortcut) option to use one.

#### Formatters

Results can be emitted as TAP, CSV and JSON. ``plain`` format is most useful for human beings :)

#### Parameters

Formatters can be provided with colon separated list of options:

```
$ phantomas http://foo.net -R csv:no-header:timestamp
```

This will omit CSV headers row and add current timestamp as the first column, so you can append the results line to a growing file.

##### CSV
* ``no-header`` - omit CSV header
* ``timestamp`` - add the current timestamp as the first column
* ``url`` - add the URL as the first column

##### JSON
* ``pretty`` - emits pretty printed JSON

##### Plain
* ``no-color`` - disable ANSI colors

##### StatsD
* ``<host>:<port>:<prefix>`` - shorthand for ``--statsd-host``, ``--statsd-port`` and ``--statsd-prefix`` (you don't need to provide all three options)

##### TAP
* ``no-skip`` - don't print out metrics that were skipped

##### StatsD
* ``<host>:<port>:<prefix>`` - shorthand for ``--statsd-host``, ``--statsd-port`` and ``--statsd-prefix`` (you don't need to provide all three options)

#### StatsD integration

Metrics from phantomas run can be sent directly to [StatsD](http://codeascraft.com/2011/02/15/measure-anything-measure-everything/) and then graphed using [graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/), [graphene](http://jondot.github.io/graphene/) or any other tool of your choice. For instance:

```
$ phantomas http://app.net/start -R statsd --statsd-host stats.app.net --statsd-port 8125 --statsd-prefix 'myApp.mainPage.'
```

or

```
$ phantomas http://app.net/start -R statsd:stats.app.net:8125:myApp.mainPage.
```

will sent metrics to StatsD running on ``stats.app.net:8125`` and prefix them with 'myApp.mainPage'.

### 3rd-party reporters

> These need to be installed on demand as 3rd party npm packages

* [AWS CloudWatch](https://github.com/EFF/phantomas-reporter-cloudwatch)
* [elasticsearch](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas-reporter-elasticsearch)

## Engines

phantomas can be run using [PhantomJS 2.1.x](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas/issues/488) (WebKit-powered headless browser) or [SlimerJS](https://slimerjs.org/) (Gecko-based non headless browser, run using [`xfvb`](http://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml)).

**PhantomJS 2.1.x is a default engine**.

You can choose the engine by using either:

* cli option: ``--engine=[webkit|gecko]`` or ``--webkit`` / ``--gecko``
* `PHANTOMAS_ENGINE` environmental variable: e.g. `PHANTOMAS_ENGINE=gecko`

> Please note that **support for SlimerJS is experimental at this point**.

### PhantomJS

All required binaries have already been installed by npm. No extra work needed here :)

### SlimerJS

In order to use SlimerJS install the following Debian/Ubuntu packages:

```
sudo aptitude install xvfb libasound2 libgtk2.0-0
```

You will also need to install the module:

```bash
npm install --global slimerjs@^0.906.1
```

## For developers

* [Project's wiki](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas/wiki)
* Description of [events fired by phantomas core](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas/wiki/Events)
* Description of [helper functions available to the browser in window.__phantomas](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas/wiki/Phantomas-scope)

## Custom modules

You can load your own, custom phantomas modules using `--include-dirs` option:

```
phantomas --include-dirs /my/path/to/custom/modules/ --url http://example.com
```

> `/my/path/to/custom/modules/` directory should contain custom modules, **each in its own directory**, e.g. `/my/path/to/custom/modules/fooBar/fooBar.js`.
