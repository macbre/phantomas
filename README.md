PhantomJS-based modular web performance metrics collector. And why phantomas? Well, [because](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantômas) :)

[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/phantomas.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/phantomas)
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/macbre/phantomas.png)](http://travis-ci.org/macbre/phantomas)

[![Download stats](https://nodei.co/npm/phantomas.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/phantomas/)


## Requirements

* [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)
* [PhantomJS 1.9+](http://phantomjs.org/)

## Installation

```
npm install --global phantomas
```

> This will install the latest version of PhantomJS and add a symlink called ``phantomas`` (pointing to ``./bin/phantomas.js``) to your system's ``PATH``

You may need to install libfontconfig by running ``sudo apt-get install libfontconfig1``.

## Features

* modular approach - each metric is generated by a separate "module"
* phantomas "core" acts as an [events emitter](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas/wiki/Events) that each module can hook into
* in-depth metrics such as: number of events bound via jQuery, calls to ``window.write``or [complex and duplicated CSS selectors (via analyze-css)](https://github.com/macbre/analyze-css)
* JSON and CSV as available output formats for easy integration with automated reporting / monitoring tools
* easy integration with Continuous Integration tools via TAP format and assertions handling
* metrics can be sent via StatsD or stored in elasticsearch
* easy integration with other nodejs projects via CommonJS module ([see API docs](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas/wiki/npm-module))
* metrics can be emitted from JavaScript code of the page phantomas is run against (thanks to [helper functions available in window.__phantomas](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas/wiki/Phantomas-scope))
* device profiles allow phantomas to emulate mobile or tablet (by setting a proper user agent and viewport)
* ability to run phantomas using WebKit (PhantomJS) or Gecko (SlimerJS) engine (experimental)

Take a look at [analyze-css README](https://github.com/macbre/analyze-css) for the full list of metrics.

* cssParsingErrors: number of CSS files (or embeded CSS) that failed to be parse by analyze-css

### Reporters

phantomas provides a number of reporters that can format the run results and send them to various tools. Use ``--reporter`` (or ``-R`` shortcut) option to use one.

#### Formatters

Results can be emitted as TAP, CSV and JSON. ``plain`` format is most useful for human beings :)

#### Parameters

Formatters can be provided with colon separated list of options:

```
$ phantomas http://foo.net -R csv:no-header:timestamp
```

This will omit CSV headers row and add current timestamp as the first column, so you can append the results line to a growing file.

##### CSV
* ``no-header`` - omit CSV header
* ``timestamp`` - add the current timestamp as the first column
* ``url`` - add the URL as the first column

##### Elasticsearch
* ``<host>:<port>:<index>:<type>`` - shorthand for ``--elasticsearch-*`` options

##### JSON
* ``pretty`` - emits pretty printed JSON

##### Plain
* ``no-color`` - disable ANSI colors

##### StatsD
* ``<host>:<port>:<prefix>`` - shorthand for ``--statsd-host``, ``--statsd-port`` and ``--statsd-prefix`` (you don't need to provide all three options)

##### TAP
* ``no-skip`` - don't print out metrics that were skipped

#### StatsD integration

Metrics from phantomas run can be sent directly to [StatsD](http://codeascraft.com/2011/02/15/measure-anything-measure-everything/) and then graphed using [graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/), [graphene](http://jondot.github.io/graphene/) or any other tool of your choice. For instance:

```
$ phantomas http://app.net/start -R statsd --statsd-host stats.app.net --statsd-port 8125 --statsd-prefix 'myApp.mainPage.'
```

or

```
$ phantomas http://app.net/start -R statsd:stats.app.net:8125:myApp.mainPage.
```

will sent metrics to StatsD running on ``stats.app.net:8125`` and prefix them with 'myApp.mainPage'.

#### Save metrics to Elasticsearch

Metrics from phantomas run can be outputted directly in Elasticsearch :

##### Parameters

* `--elasticsearch-host=[ip]` Elasticsearch instance ip (default : 127.0.0.1)
* `--elasticsearch-port=[port]` Elasticsearch instance port (default : 9200)
* `--elasticsearch-index=[index_name]` Name of the index to use
* `--elasticsearch-type=[type_name]` Name of the document type to use

Or by using reporter options (``<host>:<port>:<index>:<type>``):

```
$ phantomas http://app.net/start -R elasticsearch:es.app.net::app:phantomas_metrics
```

Note: as ``<port>`` option was skipped a default value will be used (``9200``).

## Engines

phantomas can be run using PhantomJS (WebKit-powered headless browser) or SlimerJS (Gecko-bease non headless browser, run using xfvb). Use either ``--engine=[webkit|gecko]`` or ``--webkit`` / ``--gecko`` parameters to choose one. Please note that **support for SlimerJS is experimental at this point**.

### PhantomJS

All required binaries are installed by npm. No extra work needed here :)

### SlimerJS

In order to use SlimerJS install the following Debian/Ubuntu packages:

```
sudo aptitude install xvfb libasound2 libgtk2.0-0
```
