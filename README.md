PhantomJS-based modular web performance metrics collector. And why phantomas? Well, [because](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantômas) :)

[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/phantomas.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/phantomas)
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/macbre/phantomas.png)](http://travis-ci.org/macbre/phantomas)
[![Bitdeli Badge](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/macbre/phantomas/trend.png)](https://bitdeli.com/free "Bitdeli Badge")

## Requirements

* [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)
* [PhantomJS 1.9+](http://phantomjs.org/)

## Installation

```
npm install --global phantomas
```

> This will install the latest version of PhantomJS and add a symlink called ``phantomas`` (pointing to ``./bin/phantomas.js``) to your system's ``PATH``

## Features

* Modular approach - each metric is generated by a separate "module"
* phantomas "core" acts as an [events emitter](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas/wiki/Events) that each module can hook into
* in-depth metrics such as: number of events bound via jQuery, calls to ``window.write``or [complex and duplicated CSS selectors (via analyze-css)](https://github.com/macbre/analyze-css)
* JSON and CSV as available output formats for easy integration with automated reporting / monitoring tools
* easy integration with Continous Integration tools via TAP format and assertions handling
* easy integration with other nodejs projects via CommonJS module ([see API docs](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas/wiki/npm-module))
* metrics can be emitted from JavaScript code of the page phantomas is run against (thanks to [helper functions available in window.__phantomas](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas/wiki/Phantomas-scope))

## Usage

> phantomas comes as both command line tool and CommonJS module ([see API docs](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas/wiki/npm-module)) that you can use in your nodejs projects.

### Single run

``` bash
phantomas --url https://github.com/macbre/phantomas --verbose
```

You can measure the performance of your site without requests to 3rd party domains (but allowing CDN that serves your static assets):

```bash
phantomas --url https://github.com/macbre/phantomas --verbose --no-externals --allow-domain .fastly.net
```

#### Parameters

* `--url` URL of the page to generate metrics for (required)
* `--format=[json|csv|tap|plain]` output format (``plain`` is the default one)
* `--timeout=[seconds]` timeout for phantomas run (defaults to 15 seconds)
* `--viewport=[width]x[height]` phantomJS viewport dimensions (1280x1024 is the default)
